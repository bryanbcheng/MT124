General observations:
*** Simon

The F language you're working with and any general observations about it, including particular challenges in translating your choice of F language to English (relative to other possible choices for F).
We are translating from German to English.

One of the biggest problems we had was translating words that do not have an exact English translation. This included all the different types of schools and we were only able to generalize them to for example vocational school or trade school. 
*******Simon: EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THIS??%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% There seems to be many such words like this which are really specific, yet can only be generalized into many words in the English language.

One option for this would be to try and flesh out a full definition for each word even though it will make the translated text much longer, but will be more clear and informative. Another choice could have been to leave the original word as is and hope the reader knows some information about the native German word.

****************************************************************************************

Rules:
1) Finding and moving the subject of the sentence after a prepositional phrase: 

2) ***Simon

3) Giving a subject to a verb, making the noun [phrase] following a verb the verb's subject: Some sentences that we found had verbs that did not have a subject. From our data set, every time this occurs, the subsequent noun phrase usually was the subject of the sentence. To fix this problem, we move the noun right before the verb. The sentences that we fixed for this were "There learn they" -> "There they learn", "After goes one" -> "After one goes", and "Before recently is the time" -> "Before recently the time is". This change makes the sentence more English-like, where typically the structure is [subject][verb][object/none].

5) ***Simon

6) ***Simon related to 4

7) ***Simon

mention merged with 6 second half moving verb at end when no modal (implicitly swapping VBN)

Swapping consecutive past participles: In German, if there is a sentence with multiple past participles in the past perfect tense, their orders are swapped. For example, consider the sentence in our text: 'Vor kurzem ist die Zeit auf dem Gymnasium von neun auf acht Jahre reduziert worden', which in a word-by-word translation translates to 'Before recently, is the time on high school reduced been', when it should translate to 'Recently, the time in high school has been reduced from nine years to eight years'. While there are various problems in this translation, one obvious problem is that the order of 'reduziert' (reduced) and 'worden' (been) is 'reduziert worden' (reduced been). In order to correct for this, we swap any two consecutive past participles because in German, the main past participle is always after the subordinate past participle.

8) Match verb with with preposition: Often times, the direct translation from German to English using word by word translation results in a wrong preposition for the verb. For example, we see a lot that "go … on" appears a lot in the pre-rules text. This is because in German "go … on" is the correct way to say "go … to". So in English, we have a lot of these verb-preposition pairs. Using just a simple dictionary that contains the verb-preposition pairs we say in the translated text, we corrected the preposition to match the verb.  

9) Perfect tense fix: This is a simple change. From our previous rule that modified past participles, we moved the VBN after 'is' and 'are'. In English, to make this grammatically correct, it should be 'has' or 'have' depending on the preceding word. We check this and appropriately make the change.

10) Handling the Genitive Tense: One complication that we ran into while translating from German to English was elegantly handling the Genitive tense, which exists in German but not in English. The Genitive tense indicates possession in German, so if we wanted to say 'at the end of high school', we could say 'Am Ende des Gymnasiums', where the 'des' is the definite article 'the' conjugated into its Genitive form, and therefore translates to 'of the'. 'Des' is used before masculine and neuter nouns but for feminine nouns, we must use the definite article 'der' for the Genitive tense. The problem is that 'der' is used in various other tenses to mean 'the' instead of 'of the'. Therefore, when doing a word-by-word translation, we cannot be sure whether or not 'der' translates to 'the' or 'of the'. 

Our rule that to fix this was to replace any 'the' in our post-word-by-word translation with 'of the'. As an example, consider 'Ein Teil der Schüler und Schülerinnen', which means 'a part of the male pupils and female pupils' where 'der' should translate to 'of the'. However, our word-by-word translation translates this sentence to 'a part the pupil and female pupils'. Since it doesn't make sense to have just the definite article 'the' between two nouns, we change the meaning to be 'of the'.

11) ***Simon

For each rule you create, a description of what it was supposed to do, what differences between Language F and English it was supposed to fix. Make sure you give a good example of the use of the rules in your running of your code.

****************************************************************************************

Error analysis:

Because German has a lot of subtleties, often times a word by word translation is not the best approach. I think even combining this with a bigram translation model would help some of the smaller issues lost by not having the context of each word. We were able to address some of these issues for example by rule 2, which we saw after the translation, produced English that did not make sense.

Furthermore, even after our verb-preposition fix, there were still some straggling errors. For example, in sentence 8, the final transformed text is: "An other part of the pupil and female pupils goes to the elementary school on the junior high school." The original text was "… pupils goes from the elementary school on the junior high school." We can see that this structure should have been "goes from … to". Our transformer, only detects the first preposition after the word. To fix this, we could consider using a much more extensive verb-predicate dictionary which also contains pairs of prepositions or more after each verb. Or, we could see that "from" is a viable preposition after go and leave it as is, while based on our understanding of German and English, change only the "on"s to "to"s.

One more major problem we see with our final output is the excessive determiners (DT, i.e. the). In German, typically before each noun we have such a determiner. *** SIMON CAN YOU EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE GERMAN SUBTLETY OF THIS?*** However, when translating to English, it's difficult to distinguish between no article (general case), definite article (specific case), and indefinite article (general case, with subtleties). Thus, to solve this, we would have to first determine whether the German text is referring to general or specific case, and if general, using a set of rules determine whether we need no article or whether an article can be used.

Lastly, from using the POS tagger, some of the words were not tagged correctly. Just given the Stanford Log-linear POS Tagger, it still made some mistakes. In sentence 3 and 5, separate and search were classified as JJ (adjective) and NN (noun) respectively, when they should have been verbs. If they were classified as verbs correctly, some of our verb based rules could have been applied to it such as moving the subject of the sentence before it.

****************************************************************************************

Comparative analysis for Google Translate:

For the most part, I felt like our translation was similar to Google's, especially sentences 2,4,6,7,8,10,12, which are nearly identical in structure and words translated to.

It looks like one advantage of Google Translate is they take the context of a word before translating it. We were limited to translating word by word and lose some of this context. For example, by itself 'der' means 'the'. But in some contexts, like the Genitive tense, 'der' means 'of the'.

Google Translate also does a better job constructing the sentences to be more grammatically correct English sentences, adding, removing, and replacing words to make them closer to natural English. Because Google has extensive n-gram data models as well as other models, they can use this to tweak the phrases in the sentences appropriately. It also adjusts words to fit the sentence better, for example in our translation of sentence 11, it uses "prepared" while their translation correctly uses prepares.

Because the rules for our translation model was based on this sample text, a couple sentences we had turned out to be better. This is seen best in sentences 14 and 15. Our sentence 14 has a better definition for "Abitur", while there's translated it to "baccalauréat". Lastly, our last sentence, we still retain the meaning while their sentence does not make any sense.

Member responsibilities:

Because Simon has some knowledge of German, he helped with manually translating the text. Since we were just translating word by word, both of us were able to input each word into a dictionary and get the first definition.

Simon wrote the code to read in our dictionary, perform the translation word for word, and then output this data. Bryan linked up the Stanford POS tagger and read in Simon's output, then produced another file with each words POS appended to each word.

For the transformations afterward, Simon knew more of the language so came up with some obvious rules. Bryan did most of the coding for these rules, and Simon spent time tweaking them. Both of us contributed to writing this report.
